[Jektify](https://github.com/jektify/jektify) is beautiful and Customizable, much more appealing than a simple "iframe"!

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a jewel using to enter a theme for track entry, playlist, albums and artists of [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com), in Jekyll templates.

Besides inserting music is fully responsive, adjusting as your page layout, even on mobile devices.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

*JavaScript*

[Jektify](https://github.com/jektify/jektify) uses javascript, where it is located in the folder "`src/js/jektify.js`". All Javascript code must be written to it, regardless of whether it uses ES6 or not. Gem will use it in the folder "`assets/js`", and you need to minify it with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to play it there. To do this, run on the terminal in the root directory of Jektify:

```shell
gulp
```

*Sass*


To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
